### Command-interceptor

Command interceptor is a program that intercepts certain commands entered by the user in the Linux terminal and blocks their execution. The program works as an add-on before the "execute" stage, written in C.

To integrate this program into your work environment, you need to clone the project and run the Makefile, which will compile the code into an .s–æ file and integrate it into your OS.

To remove the interceptor, you need to run the bash script antilogger.sh, which is attached to the program.
