### Command-interceptor

<b>Command interceptor<\b> is a program that intercepts certain commands entered by the user in the Linux terminal and blocks their execution. The program works as an add-on before the "execute" stage, written in C.

To integrate this program into your work environment, you need to clone the project and run the <b>Makefile<\b>, which will compile the code into an .s–æ file and integrate it into your OS.

To remove the interceptor, you need to run the bash script <b>antilogger.sh<\b>, which is attached to the program.
